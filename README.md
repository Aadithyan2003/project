This is a Diabetes prediction model in which we are building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. 
This project is done in Python. 
In this project, we use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.
The 'diabetes.csv' contains the dataset for the project and the 'Diabetes Prediction.ipynb' file is the python source code file
